supervised ML(known o/p) -> regression and classification
regression -> when output is continuous
classification -> when output has fixed no of categories 
classification -> binary, multiclass, multilable classification

binary -> 1 o/p with two categories eg, 
            height + weight => gender(o/p) 
              _        _          M
              _        _          F  
              
              so here we can see that there is only one o/p i.e, gender 
              that has two categories.
 
multicalss -> 1 o/p with more than two categories eg,
             height + weight => gender(o/p) 
              _        _          M
              _        _          F  
              _        _          N
              so here we can see that there is only one o/p i.e, gender
              but it has three categories.
              
Multilable -> It has many o/ps eg,
         Movies |  Action    Romance   thriller   suspense  
        Endgame :     1         0         1          1
        So, here we have more than one o/p i.e, more than one o/p categories.


Unsupervised ML(unknown o/p) -> clustering, segmentation, reduce dimension

semi-supervised ML 

Deep learning -> ANN and CNN and  RNN
ANN ->  inputs are in the form of tabular kind of datasets
           features1  |  features2 | ....     o/p
                      |            |
                      |            |
                      
                       
CNN ->  Images, videos 

RNN -> text, time series, sequential data
